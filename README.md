Algorithm & Data Structure Solutions

This repository contains solutions to several popular algorithm and data structure problems, implemented in C++. Each problem includes a brief description, example inputs and outputs, and the corresponding code solution.

Problems Included
1. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Problem: Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Examples:

Input: "abcabcbb" → Output: 3 ("abc")

Input: "bbbbb" → Output: 1 ("b")

Input: "pwwkew" → Output: 3 ("wke")

2. 3Sum

Problem: Given an integer array nums, return all unique triplets [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]] such that i != j != k and nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0.

Example:

Input: [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4] → Output: [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]

3. Detect Cycle in a Linked List

Problem: Given the head of a linked list, determine if the list contains a cycle.

Example:

Input: [3,2,0,-4] (cycle at index 1) → Output: true

Input: [] (no cycle) → Output: false

4. Coin Change (Fewest Coins)

Problem: Given an array of coin denominations and an amount, return the minimum number of coins needed to make the amount. If impossible, return -1.

Example:

Input: coins = [1,2,5], amount = 11 → Output: 3 (5+5+1)

Input: coins = [2], amount = 3 → Output: -1

Input: coins = [1], amount = 0 → Output: 0

5. Kth Smallest Element in a BST

Problem: Given a BST and an integer k, return the kth smallest element.

Example:

Input: root = [3,1,4,null,2], k = 1 → Output: 1

Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], k = 3 → Output: 3
